## IBM HR attrition analytics

The aim of the project is to analyse the dataset and understand which employees are likely to leave the organization and factors which induced them to arrive at this decision by following the CRISP-DM methodology in R. This prediction can be incorporated by organizations to curb attrition and retain valuable talent. The project encompasses the following objectives: 

1. Identify employees who are likely to leave the organization, based on which an organization could either focus on retention or proactively plan for replacement to avoid single point failures if any.

2. Identify decisive factors leading to employeeâ€™s resignation to understand and improve the work culture.

3. Potential cost benefits to the organisation by predicting the attrition rate.

4. Identify the likelihood of employee resignation from a specific job role or department to identitfy underlying issues.
